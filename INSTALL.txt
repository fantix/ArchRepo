Tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Names in () are usually Ubuntu packages.

System Dependencies
===================

 * PostgreSQL >= 8.4, 9.1 preferred
   * with header files (libpq-dev, required by psycopg2)
   * Some tips creating user and database:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser -s `whoami`
    $ createdb archrepo

 * bsdtar (required by Pacman repo-add)
 * repo-add, repo-remove (offered by Pacman)
 * liblzma-dev (required by pyliblzma)
 * libzmq-dev (required by pyzmq)
 * Python >= 2.6, < 3
   * with header files (python-dev, required for compiling Python libraries)
   * pip is recommended for installing Python dependencies (python-pip)
   * using virtualenv is recommended (python-virtualenv), you need to set it up:

    $ virtualenv /home/arch/env --distribute --no-site-packages
    $ source /home/arch/env/bin/activate
    (env)$ python --version
    (env)$ deactivate

 * GCC, make (build-essential, required for compiling Python libraries)
 * Kernel supporting inotify
 * /bin/fuser (psmsic)


Python Dependencies
===================

Note, if you are not using virtualenv, you probably need root access for the
following "pip" commands, or using system packages delivered with your Linux
distribution at your own risk.

 * Gevent >= 1.0b3 (pip install http://gevent.googlecode.com/files/gevent-1.0b3.tar.gz)
 * PyBabel (pip install babel)
 * Others will be installed together automatically with ArchRepo through pip:
   - pyinotify  (python-pyinotify)
   - ujson
   - cherrypy   (python-cherrypy)
   - jinja2     (python-jinja2)
   - psycopg2   (python-psycopg2)
   - pyliblzma  (python-lzma)
   - gevent_zeromq


Install
=======

    pip install ArchRepo-VERSION.tar.gz


Configure
=========

The base config can be found under $PREFIX/etc/archrepo.ini, where $PREFIX can
be $VIRTUAL_ENV (e.g. /home/arch/env) or /usr/local/ according to your
installation. It is not recommended to edit this file directly, instead copy it
over to either:

 * $PREFIX/etc/archrepo_local.ini, or
 * ~/.archrepo.ini

And edit your own copy, so that your local changes will not be flushed during an
ArchRepo package upgrade. The order the server will find a value is:

    $HOME/.archrepo.ini -> archrepo_local.ini -> archrepo.ini -> builtin default

See archrepo.ini for more configuration description.


Run Web Server
==============

Within virtualenv if any, run directly:

    $ archrepo_serve.py -v0

If you need more logs, try -v1 (info) and -v2 (debug).


Run inotify monitor
===================

Within virtualenv if any, run directly:

    $ archrepo_inotify.py


Manually synchronize
====================

Within virtualenv if any, with or without a running web server, run directly:

    $ archrepo_sync.py

It will automatically add files not in DB into the repository, and remove
packages whose files are removed from disk. With the inotify monitor running,
you usually don't have to run this. But it is normally required for the first
setup, or the inotify monitor stopped working for a while.

It will not check updated files with the same file name. If you need this, just
touch the file while the inotify monitor is running.
